# ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction (Ongoing Project)

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke using health-related data.  
We explore preprocessing, feature selection, handling imbalanced data, and machine learning models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/` â†’ raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks (EDA, preprocessing, training)
- `src/` â†’ Python scripts for modular code
- `results/` â†’ metrics and visualizations

## ðŸš€ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/stroke-prediction-ml.git
cd stroke-prediction-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
